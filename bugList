1. When moving the fox, it can move on top of a hound
- Reproduction steps: Set up all the players, then move the fox, then try to move it on top of a hound
- Expected result: The fox should not be able to move on top of the square that the hound is in.
- Actual result: The fox IS able to move on top of the square that a hound is in.
===============================
2. When setting the players, one player can overwrite another. 
- Reproduction steps: If I place the fox on (0,0), then I place a hound on (0,0), the fox is covered up by the hound.
- Expected result: The program should not allow you to place one player on top of another
- Actual result: The 2nd player covers up the first if they are placed on the same tile.
